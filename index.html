				<p> Hello there! I am an international student from Malaysia and this is my second year living in United States. I love food and coming from a multi-racial country, the States offer a vast different of food to try that I cannot found in my home country. I am taking my chance being here by expanding my cuisine experience so I could give recommendations to my friends and family when they are travelling. I like being at different places so I travel a lot too.  Hope you are ready for an adventure!</p>

				<p> Here are some places I would recommend, and I will be reviewing what food I had while I was at these places. </p>

					<dt><b>Madison, Wisconsin</b></dt>
					<dd> Ah! The capitol city of the state of Wisconsin. Probably my second home since I am going to school here. I spend my free time exploring different kinds of cuisines offered here. From Italian fine dining to a quick Chinese takeout, I would never get sick of the food here. </dd>
					<dt><b>Portland, Oregon</b></dt>
					<dd>One of my favourite places to go in Pacific Northwest region. The nature is beyond beautiful, the weather is just nice especially in the summer. Spoiler alert: you may find weird people, but they are <i> good</i> weird people. The last time I went here was summer 2023 but Portland, you still have my heart.</dd>
					<dt><b>Seattle, Washington</b></dt>
					<dd>Another state in Pacific Northwest you should go! The state parks nearby are so breath-taking and one of the gems in the States, but if you prefer the hustle-bustle of city life, Seattle is the perfect place! There are many cuisines you can find here, and I would recommend taking a walk  a lot so you could appreciate the skyline view here.</dd>
